Project: Pedigree Builder (PeB)

Project Team Members: Darius Carrier, Bryan Fleming, Cody McCarter, Andrew Phillips

Justification: In Genetic Centers various diseases and their lineages are analyzed through pedigree charts. Many times these charts are required to be hand drawn making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Due to this fact less time is being taken on analyzing the charts and more on drawing the charts themselves. This is the exact case as it relates to the Greenwood Genetics Center. The geneticists need an efficient and effective program that can and will generate a pedigree chart from a given set of data. This will make the analysis of pedigrees a quicker and easier process.

Beneficiaries: The primary benefactor is the Greenwood Genetic Center. That being said, this program could potentially aid any geneticist that frequently uses or creates pedigree diagrams. This program could become a staple of pedigree research.
